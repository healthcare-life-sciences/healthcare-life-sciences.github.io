          <h2>How Multimodal Data Combined with Large-Scale AI Is Transforming Research & Development of Medicines</h2>
          <div>
          <p class="text-left">This talk will explore the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in informing the entire clinical development lifecycle of therapeutics, from early stages of drug discovery to late-stage clinical trials leveraging a variety of digital measurements. AI/ML technologies, including the latest Generative AI capabilities play a transformative role in accelerating drug candidate identification, predicting safety and efficacy, optimizing patient recruitment, and enabling personalized medicine approaches. These technologies leverage clinical trial, RWE, wearables and molecular data to inform drug safety and efficacy as well as to help meet patients where they are. The talk will briefly touch on the challenges and collaborations required for the ethical and responsible use of AI/ML in drug development, highlighting the immense potential of these technologies to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry and deliver safer and more effective treatments to patients.</p>
